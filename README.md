### My Process

1. Alinged the items/content both vertically and horizontally center by using (<style>
    body{
        display: flex;
        align-items: center;
        justify-content: center;
    }
</style>)

2. Created a Wrapper for my contents and alinged in center at flex-start and also direction of items to column by using flex box:

3. After that just have to add font-size, background, padding, margin and border-radius and some little touchups.
